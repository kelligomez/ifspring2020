       This is my Hello World Document. Written in html.

       My name is Kelli Gomez. I'm a junior majoring in Creative Writing with a focus in poetry, and ComDes

    </p>
    <p> 
       Being a poet and designer, I am taking this class because I want creative freedom over how my work is presented in a digital format. This class seems perfect for wanting to learn the basics so that I may build my own interactive structures to show my work.

       Other than tumblr during my middle school years, I have no previous expereince with html/css/js! So I'm very excited to learn.

       I hope to learn how to build really awesome and colorful websites.

       I expect the main difference between designing for screen is the component of language, and designing with the sensibility that my work will be described by markup. I'm sure that my creative methods will have to be distilled from what I normally do for making 2D work.

       I think that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> is a website with effective design because the interface is very specific to the kind of media that is featured, which are videos and sometimes gifs.

       An example I found for a web design with effective communication is <a href=https://www.dominos.com/en>This website.</a>
       For websites like food ordering services, it makes sense that the designers were prioritizing clarity of contect.

       While most to all of the creators featured on this website are garb, <a href="http://https://fanjoy.co/">FanJoy</a> works really well in organizing the content, and makes the experience basically seamless for an individual looking to buy some bad merch!
